"""
This is just a SAMPLE component using the opinionated design patterns
this CLI package decided to use (i.e. React-style functional components).

EXAMPLE USAGE:

```python
from components.sample import SampleComponent
from dash import html

# Use in a layout such as in ANOTHER component, page, or `app.py` main layout.
# It should be INSTANTIATED inside a list of `children`, not directly.
layout = html.Div([
    SampleComponent("Hello, World!"),
])
```

Or use directly in another component's children:

```python
html.Div(children=[SampleComponent("Hello, World!"), ...])
```
"""

from dash import html


def SampleComponent(title: str) -> html.Div:
    """Sample component.

    Args:
        title: The title text to display in the component.

    Returns:
        A Dash html.Div component containing an H1 element with the title.
    """
    return html.Div([
        html.H1(title, className="text-xl uppercase"),
    ])
